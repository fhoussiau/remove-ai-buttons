## Why?

Tired of seeing `Copilot` buttons everywhere on GitHub? Fed up with the `Gemini` options on all Google product? _(don't you want to summarise a folder??)_

## How?

- Install [UBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/) on your browser.
- Open its dashboard (gear icon in the pop-up).
- In the "My filters" tab, import the content of [ublock-static-filters.txt](./ublock-static-filters.txt).

## Where?

- Gmail (Gemini)
- Google Drive (Gemini)
- Google Docs (Gemini)
- Google Meet (Gemini)
- Github (Copilot)

## Disclaimers

This list is hand-curated by me, for websites that I use. It is not exhaustive, even on these websites, and it's possible that genuine (non-AI) features might be made unavailable. Feel free to [make a pull request](https://github.com/fhoussiau/remove-ai-buttons/pulls) to add more.

Also, all of these blocks are susceptible to fail at any point -- I'll try to update them relatively frequently.
